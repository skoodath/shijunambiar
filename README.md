## Built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)

I used `NextJS` as part of my learning to build this website. Next removed all complexities and make it easy for me to build this `ReactJS` website. `Next` gave a layer of abstraction above `React`.

## Styled with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

`Sass` made it easy to write CSS. Although I didn't use a lot of features like `mixins`, It was still convenient over using `vanilla CSS`. `NextJS` api made it easier to modularize `css` without worrying about compiling `Sass` to `css` which is taken care of. Ever since I started using `Sass`, I barely go back to `vanilla CSS`.

## Deployed on Vercel

Throughout development, I deployed the site on vercel which made it easier for me to test for performance and responsiveness on real devices.

The simple CICD process in which I used _github_ for **continuous integration** and vercel would build and deploy the site to production.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
